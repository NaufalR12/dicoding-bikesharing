## Setup environment
- Install Visual Studio Code for Editor
- Execute this command on command line ( as administrator prefered)
```
pip install pandas streamlit plotly scikit-learn
```

## Project installation
The steps to create your virtual environment from this project is as follows:

1. Clone this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/maulanakavaldo/bike_sharing.git
   ```

2. Move to directory bike_sharing/
   ```
   cd bike_sharing
   ```
3. Run streamlit app
   ```
   streamlit run bike-sharing-dashboard.py
   ```
4. Stop the application program by `ctrl + c`.

**Note:**

In the dashboard folder there are 2 files (.py):
1. bike-sharing-dashboard.py: visualization using built-in streamlit
2. bike-sharing-dashboard-plotly.py: visualization using an additional library namely plotly.express, which in my opinion with plotly you can customize the graphics more.

**! There may be differences in directory order, so make sure you enter the correct directory.**

**Thank youuu!!**
